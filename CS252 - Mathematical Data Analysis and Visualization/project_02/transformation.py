    def __init__(self, orig_dataset, data=None):
        '''Constructor for a Transformation object

        Parameters:
        -----------
        orig_dataset: Data object. shape=(N, num_vars).
            Contains the original dataset (only containing all the numeric variables,
            `num_vars` in total).
        data: Data object (or None). shape=(N, num_proj_vars).
            Contains all the data samples as the original, but ONLY A SUBSET of the variables.
            (`num_proj_vars` in total). `num_proj_vars` <= `num_vars`

        TODO:
        - Pass `data` to the superclass constructor.
        - Create an instance variable for `orig_dataset`.

    def project(self, headers):
        '''Project the original dataset onto the list of data variables specified by `headers`,
        i.e. select a subset of the variables from the original dataset.
        In other words, your goal is to populate the instance variable `self.data`.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        headers: Python list of str. len(headers) = `num_proj_vars`, usually 1-3 (inclusive), but
            there could be more.
            A list of headers (strings) specifying the feature to be projected onto each axis.
            For example: if headers = ['hi', 'there', 'cs251'], then the data variables
                'hi' becomes the 'x' variable,
                'there' becomes the 'y' variable,
                'cs251' becomes the 'z' variable.
            The length of the list matches the number of dimensions onto which the dataset is
            projected â€” having 'y' and 'z' variables is optional.

        TODO:
        - Create a new `Data` object that you assign to `self.data` (project data onto the `headers`
        variables). Determine and fill in 'valid' values for all the `Data` constructor
        keyword arguments (except you dont need `filepath` because it is not relevant here).

        -----------
        ndarray. shape=(N, num_proj_vars+1). The projected data array with an added 'fake variable'
        column of ones on the right-hand side.
            For example: If we have the data SAMPLE (just one row) in the projected data array:
            [3.3, 5.0, 2.0], this sample would become [3.3, 5.0, 2.0, 1] in the returned array.
