### Overview of Repository
This repository stores all the projects I undertook as an undergradute CS student project. The reportory is divided by every course I took (excluding Jan Plan coures) and all the projects I took for that course are stored inside that subdirectory. Here is a outline of what each course focused on:

### CS231 - Data Structures and Algorthims
I took this course in my fall semester as a freshman. This course is focused on introducing standard data structures and algorthims, and understanding the benefits and drawbacks of each data structures and algorthims. This included understanding how to calculate space and time complexity of each standard algorhtims. Some of the data structures covered in this course are linked list, queues, binary trees, and graphs. In addition, the course focused being able to implement classical search, sort, and traversal algorthims.

### CS333 - Programming Languages
I took this course in my spring semester as a freshman. This couse is focused on understanding the basic design of a programming language and comparing different language families. The course is split into the different aspects of a programming languages. Each aspect/topic is assigned a project. Some of the topics covered in the course are syntax, semantics, memory management.

### CS232 - Computer Organization
I took this course in my fall semester as a sophomore. This course is focused on learning about the core hardware componenets such as the memory storage, input and output, and the CPU. I learn how these components work starting from learning from a basic electrical component level and builds up to learning about machine code and finally to assembly code. 

### CS252 - Mathematical Data Analysis and Visualization
I took this course in my spring semester as a sophomore. This course is focused on learning about fundamental machine learning concepts, data management, basic statistical analysis, and data mining techniques. For the projects in this class, I learn different techniques for visualizing my data that help me find patterns in data sets. There is an emphasis on learning the mathematical basis of the algoritms used in this course. Some algoritms require calculus and linear algebra to compute. I am currently taking this course. As a result, this part of the repository is not complete.
