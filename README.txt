This reportory stores all the projects I undertook as an undergradute CS student project. The reportory is divided by every course I took (excluding Jan Plan coures) and all the projects I took for that course are stored inside that subdirectory. Here is a outline of what each course focused on:

CS231:
I took this course in my 1st semester as a freshman. This course is focused on introducing standard data structures and algorthims, and understanding the benefits and drawbacks of each data structures and algorthims. This included understanding how to calculate space and time complexity of each standard algorhtims. Some of the data structures covered in this course are linked list, queues, binary trees, and graphs. In addition, the course focused being able to implement classical search, sort, and traversal algorthims.

CS333:
I took this course in my 2nd semester as a freshman. This couse is focused on understanding the basic design of a programming language and comparing different language families. The course is split into the different aspects of a programming languages. Each aspect/topic is assigned a project. Some of the topics covered in the course are syntax, semantics, memory management.
