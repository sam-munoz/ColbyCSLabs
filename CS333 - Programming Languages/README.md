This README file is intented to outline what each project is about. The projects below are listed in chronological order these projects were presented in class.

---

**Project 1: Introduction to C Language**  
For this first project, the main focus was to introduce C. All projects are split into C tasks and selected languages tasks. For the C tasks, many of them focused on introducing basic data types and memory access/management. There was no source code for selected langauges. Instead, I was tasked to do some research about several different programming languages.

**Project 2: Introduction to non-C Language**  
For this project, the focus on learning about how programming languages parse text strings into a set of tokens a language can understand. Additionally, the project focused on introducing the selected languages students choice to learn. For this semester, I choice learn C++, C#, and Go. C++ and C# are the two languages I am required to write source code for each project and Go was an optional third I could do. Thus, for some future project, there may be no Go source code. For the selected langauges, I created program that is similar to a Hello World program.

**Project 3: Syntax**  
This project focused on introducing the concept of variable scope and prototyping in C and focused on learning the syntax of my selected langauges. For the C tasks, I created my own implementation of a stack by using a prototype to create fields and methods needed for this stack. I also used some global variables to control the maximum capacity of this stack. For the selected languages, I had research rules for identifier naming, variable declarations, and identifier scope. Then I searched and created code that show off all the data types in my selected 

**Project 4: Semantics**  
**Project 5: Polymorphic Types**  
**Project 6: File I/O**  
**Project 7: Memory Management**  
**Project 8: Concurrent Programming**
