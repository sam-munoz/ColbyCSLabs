This README file is intented to outline what each project is about. The projects below are listed in chronological order these projects were completed. At the end of each section, I have placed the link to the original webpage that had the instruction for each project.

---

**Project 1: Introduction to C Language**  
For this first project, the main focus was to introduce C. All projects are split into C tasks and selected languages tasks. For the C tasks, many of them focused on introducing basic data types and memory access/management. There was no source code for selected langauges. Instead, I was tasked to do some research about several different programming languages.

**Project 2: Introduction to non-C Language**  
For this project, the focus on learning about how programming languages parse text strings into a set of tokens a language can understand. Additionally, the project focused on introducing the two selected languages that students choose to learn. For this semester, I choice learn C++, C#, and Go. C++ and C# are my two selected languages and are include in every project unless exceptions are made in another project. Go is an optional language I choose to learn. To introduce the selected langauges, I created program that is a variation of the Hello World program.

**Project 3: Syntax**  
This project focused on introducing the concept of variable scope and prototyping in C and focused on learning the syntax of my selected langauges. For the C tasks, I created my own implementation of an stack using a prototype to create fields and methods needed for this stack. I also used some global variables to control the maximum capacity of this stack. For the selected languages, I had research rules for identifier naming, variable declarations, and identifier scope. I researched all the data types in these languages and created source code displaying all these features. I also wrote a binary search algorithm that takes in a integer array.

**Project 4: Semantics**  
This project is focused on introducing function handlers in C and exploring the control flow and determine if functions can be treated as a data types in my selected languages. For the C tasks, I created a comparator function to use with the `qsort` in the `stdlib.h` header file. I also showed how functions can be there own data types by creating a factoral function and storing in a variable. For my selected languages, I explored the control flow features in these languages and source code for them. Additionally, I also wrote code for all selected languages that supported functions as a data type. Lastly, I wrote a general sorting algorithm for each selected language.

**Project 5: Polymorphic Types**  
This project is focused on exploring polymorphism in C and in my selected languages. For all languages, I create my own implementation of linked list that can contain any data type. This linked list had implement all functions listed on the project's instruction webpage and successfully run the test file.

**Project 6: File I/O**  
This project is focused on exploring handling file and error handling features in C and my selected languages. For all languages, I created a word counter program that counts of the frequency of a word in a text file to explore file I/O features. Then, I created source code that show the error handling of every language either using signals, try-except block, etc. depending on the language being used.

**Project 7: Memory Management**  
This project is focused on exploring how memory management works for in C and my selected languages. I explored in this topic in C by creating a program that determines the time it takes allocates and deallocates large number of instances of a given data structure. I ran this program using different data structures with varying sizes. I compared the different results and explained the results using the material used in class. For my selected language, I researched how memory management works in these languages and created source code that displayed the features. I focused on how memeory allocation/deallocation works and if my language support automatic memory management.

**Project 8: Concurrent Programming**  
This project is focused on exploring paralleling programing in C and my selected langauge. For my C and one of my selected languages, I created two applications that sort an array and another that modifies an image on a pixel-by-pixel basis. These programs allow for these tasks to be split into N parts. I ran these programs, spliting the tasks into a variety of different parts and compared the results.
